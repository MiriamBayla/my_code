10 HTML tags (at least):
<div><hr><h2><h3><a><link><li>
<ul><script><p><button>

5 CSS properties (at least):
text-align, background-color, border, font-size,
padding, position, bottom, width, left.

How I used JavaScript:
To change buttons to color red when answers are incorrect, as well as when
they are correct - change them to green and print "correct!".

How I used Bootstrap:
To make a colorful list of things about me.
